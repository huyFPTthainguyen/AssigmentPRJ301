"It’s just a fact. If players tell the doctor and medical department they cannot play, as a manager, I have to accept it. I cannot force a player to play if he’s not available because he’s got an injury."Look, Edi trained the last few days and trained well but he’s still feeling it after those three training sessions.

We had our moments, we could have scored one or two goals more in the first half. Whenever we were in possession of the ball, we showed that we could create problems for them, the same is true with our transitional moments, but, in the end, they scored two goals and we only scored one. So at half-time, it was clear for us that we needed to try to score at least one if not two more goals, and once they scored the third one, which was a brilliant corner kick, we just have to admit that, it was difficult to defend it, then it was almost over. This goal killed us off because then against a team like Manchester City, the best team in the world in possession of the world, if you then still try to chase the ball high up, then you take the risk to concede another two or three more goals.”',3)

He’s got that X-factor.”And yet, for all the forewarning, for the outings (and a goal) against Leicester and Wolves last season, Elanga’s impact at first-team level in 2021/22 has still been sensational.

A shot from Rodrigo De Paul from long range needed a firm glove from David De Gea to keep the effort out of the top right-hand corner in front of the Stretford End.Fernandes and Jose Maria Gimenez had an aerial tangle of legs after 21 minutes and certainly the Reds fans in the East Stand and the lower half of the Sir Bobby Charlton stand in the corner thought the Portuguese midfielder had claims for a penalty.No award was given and the game settled down briefly from its frantic opening before Atletico had the ball in the net after 33 minutes when a sweeping move ended with Joao Felix side-footing home. The roars of the Spanish travelling fans died in their throats as the goal was ruled offside.Four minutes before half-time, though, the visitors did go ahead.The goal was shrouded in controversy.
