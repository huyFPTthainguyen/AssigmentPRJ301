His first season at United saw him unfairly scrutinised by sections of the media at every turn, but he adapted to the English game to show his true colours.The Madrid-born shot-stoppers fan-favourite status at Old Trafford has been emphasised by him claiming the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award on four occasions, more than any other player in United history. Meanwhile, he has also collected the clubs Players Player of the Year award three times, showing the high regard his team-mates hold him in. A mainstay of the Reds side, occasional captain, his efforts between the posts have earned him respect from his peers as well, illustrated by the fact he has appeared in the PFA Team of the Year five times.
